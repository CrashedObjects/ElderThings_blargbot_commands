{embedbuild;color:#E2A9F3;title:Protocol for etiquette and behaviour;fields.name:The Ultra-Basics;fields.value:  
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt be a jerk.
‚Ä¢ Give people a second chance.
‚Ä¢ IRL first, BSO second, HS third.
;fields.name:What's IN & What's OUT?;fields.value:
‚Ä¢ Swearing is fine, but don‚Äôt be an outrageously profane motherfucker.
‚Ä¢ NSFW is out - people need to be able to check Discord when they‚Äôre with family, at work, or in a public space.
‚Ä¢ Pressuring anyone to buy or use crystals is out - you and only you choose how to spend your own money.
;fields.name:Three Strikes;fields.value:
`1` You will be requested to leave for a while to check yourself (24h+).
`2` You will be banned for a while to insulate the community (24h+).
`3` You will be banned indefinitely.
;fields.name:When we might need to discipline;fields.value:
‚Ä¢ Abuse, harassment, and blatant disrespect for other members will invoke discipline.

‚Ä¢ General disagreement or offense to constructive criticism are interpersonal issues, not ones that need disciplinary action. These will be dealt with at the interpersonal level, and one or more coordinators can mediate the issue as a neutral third party if required.

‚Ä¢ You represent the order when you are a guest on other HS servers, including the official HS server. Reports of serious misconduct on those servers constitutes disrespecting the Order, and will be addressed accordingly.
;footer.text:These will be expanded upon IF and WHEN required, but we hope that never has to happen!}}
